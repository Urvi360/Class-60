        <p> I like reading books a lot. They help me learn new vocabulary words, which in turn help improve my grammar, and the ability to speak more fluently. I go to the library frequently and grab a bunch of books which I take back home to flip through and read. Currently, my favourite book series is Harry Potter, and I'm on the 4th book! The series are really interesting, especially because it's my favourite genre: fantasy and adventure! </p>
